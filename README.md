Body style: The dashboard shows the number of cars sold in each body style. The most popular body style is SUV, followed by sedan and truck.
Year: The dashboard shows the number of cars sold in each year.
Region: The dashboard shows the number of cars sold in each region.

Here are some additional insights that can be gleaned from the dashboard:

The company appears to be selling more high-end cars, as the total value of MMR (likely Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price) is higher than the total selling price. This could be because they are targeting a luxury market, or it could be that they are offering a lot of discounts on their cars.

The company is selling a lot of SUVs and trucks, which suggests that they are targeting the market for larger vehicles. This could be due to a number of factors, such as the popularity of SUVs in the current market, or the fact that the company is located in a region where there is a high demand for larger vehicles.

Overall, this dashboard provides a valuable overview of a car company's sales performance. By analyzing the data in the dashboard, car companies can identify trends, track their progress over time, and make data-driven decisions about their sales and marketing strategies.
